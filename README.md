# Secure-Easy-Voting
# Keywords: 
BLOCKCHAIN, DEEP LEARNING
# Description:
My plan is to build a software which uses a database of the voters created prior to election inclusive of the facial picture and other details so that after verification each one can be added to the blockchain network as an individual token. 
Once an individual has voted the data is immutable and the vote can be cast only once. 
The Facial Recognition feature ensures that the person represented by the idenity is casting the vote. This feature will be achieved using Siamese Networks of Deep Learning.
The usage will go as follows:
i) The voter has to register prior to election and the database is thus created consisting of the required data.
ii) The blockchain will be created adding the required blocks after verification by the other users which will be controlled by an entity.
iii) Then on the election day, the voter from the comfort of his house can caste his vote by logging in to his block after passing the facial recognition test which will can be taken using their camera comparing with our existing database.
iii) The voter will caste his vote, the data which will be stored in his block and protected after that through specific hashes.
iv) After all the votes are casted the vote counting can be quickly done as the vote count can be done as its in digital form.

# Benefits:
i) As the block of a voter is only added after verification, the system cannot be cheated.
ii) By facial recognition, only the legitimate voter can vote.
iii) Through the use of blockchain, the security is preserved and no human error can happen as no sole identity is controlling the election.
iv) Counting is updated instantaneously.
